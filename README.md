# WebCrawling_API
Crawling data from open source api and data pre-processing(cleaning)

These project is mainly about using server-side scripting (PHP) to request structural data on APIs, included Google QPX Express API, Google Maps GeoCoding API, GSA.gov, Uber Estimation Price API. The code in this repository should give you a brief concept on how to retrieve data in hierarchical thinking. The response from APIs can also export to the desired format if needed.
