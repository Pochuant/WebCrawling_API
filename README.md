# WebCrawling_API
Crawling data from open source api and data pre-processing implementation

These project is mainly about using server-side scripting (PHP) to request datasets on multiple RESTful APIs, included Google QPX Express API, Google Maps GeoCoding API, GSA.gov, Uber Estimation Price API. The code in this repository should give you a brief concept on how to retrieve data via GET/POST method. The response from APIs can also be exported into the desired format if needed.
